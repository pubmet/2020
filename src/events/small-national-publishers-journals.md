  - An international panel of editors and publishers

This panel will focus on the role of publishers/journals in the small communities, such as for example in Croatia, where most of the journals are financed by the government and included in the national platform of scientific journals HRČAK. In small communities, publishers and editors are facing numerous challenges, such as limited financial resources, small staff made of mainly volunteers, lack of technical support, lack of independent, unbiased reviewers (especially when the articles are published in a native language other than English), and mostly inability to make long-term plans due to the changes in government policies. We will discuss some of the main obstacles and propose possible solutions how to overcome these obstacles and produce scientific publications of good quality, thus providing a way to disseminate research of especially younger scientists coming from smaller research communities. Also, we will emphasize the importance of collecting the data on national platform such as HRČAK, which increases the visibility and citability of publications.
