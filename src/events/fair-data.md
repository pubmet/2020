FAIR data is the process making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.
In this workshop we will explore the reasons for you to make data FAIR, how to make data FAIR and the relationship between the FAIR data principles and the GDPR. FAIR data doesnâ€™t mean Open Data, and the workshop will focus on the limitations and possibilities when processing, archiving and sharing and reuse of personal data.
Making personal data reusable can be difficult, but not impossible. The workshop will address the legal basis for reuse of personal data (GDPR), the importance of planning and the use of a planning tool (DMP), data anonymization and infrastructure for sharing data (Research Data Archives).

The workshop will consist of a lecture and participant activities.
