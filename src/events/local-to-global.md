In this time of open access, libraries are experimenting with a wide range of models for investing in open publishing. Transformative agreements, subscribe-to-open, and pure publish agreements re-imagine the relationship with commercial and non-commercial publishers. Other approaches such as membership models, "unlatching" monographs, and cooperatives reflect the notion of sponsorship, faintly echoing the long-bygone era of patronage. Some libraries have become publishers themselves or make other investments in infrastructure. This keynote will analyze this time of exciting change and opportunity!
