Chris Hartgerink (he/him, they/them; [@chartgerink](https://twitter.com/chartgerink)) is Executive Director of [Liberate Science GmbH](https://www.libscie.org/) that is resetting research work. He was awarded his PhD in Methods and Statistics from [Tilburg University (2020) for his work on building sustainable science](https://thesiscommons.org/4wtpc/). He was a [Mozilla Open Science Fellow (2018)](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/fellowships/meet-our-fellows/) and is currently a [Shuttleworth Fellow](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/chris-hartgerink/).

They actively left academia to change the way research work is done on all levels after [reflecting on their experiences during the PhD](https://medium.com/@chartgerink/reflections-on-my-phd-and-building-sustainable-science-b32400a13da1). Together with the [Liberate Science team](https://www.libscie.org/), they're realising this on multiple levels.

Their philosophy of Open is one of equity and power distribution, instead of accumulation. It is relentlessly radical, which does not aim to burn systems down, but to (out)grow old ones.
