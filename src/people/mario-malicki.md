After finishing School of Medicine at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, I obtained an MA in Literature and Medicine at King’s College, London, UK, and then worked at the University of Split School of Medicine in Departments of Medical Humanities and Research in biomedicine and health, where I obtained my PhD in Medical Ethics titled: Integrity of scientific publications in biomedicine. I have been researching authorship, peer review, duplicate publications, and publication bias. From 2017-2019 I have been a postdoc at AMC and ASUS Amsterdam, Netherlands, and in 2020 I joined METRICS where I will focus on meta-research of preprints. I am also a Co-Editor-in-Chief of [Research Integrity and Peer Review journal](https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/).
