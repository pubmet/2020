We won't share the results, but if you like statistics, the number of participants in PUBMET Runs in the last three years was as follows:

- PUBMETRun 2018 (unofficial training) – 3
- PUBMETRun 2019 (unofficial training) – 4
- PUBMETRun 2020 (virtual race) – 5

As you can see, the number is increasing each year so next year we are expecting at least 6 runners.

Iryna sent us a nice photo from her run and she has won the prize - free participation at PUBMET2021.

We are looking forward to seeing Iryna and all of you in Zadar next year and hoping you’ll join us in the next PUBMETRun!

All the participants of PUBMET2020 are invited to take part in our first
PUBMETRun! The race is virtual. You have to run or walk 5K (5 km or 3.1
miles) and then send us a link to your workout in any application (Strava,
Garmin, Endomondo, Polar, etc) or you can send a screenshot of your
activity. You are also encouraged to send a photo or video of your run.

The competing categories are:

- The fastest PUBMETRunner (the runner with the best time for the 5K run)
- The funniest photo/video (as decided by PUBMET program committee)

You can run any time between 12 and 22 September and send us your link (or
screenshot of your activity), photos and videos at <jvilicic@pbf.hr>

The first price for both categories is free participation at PUBMET2021.
See you in Zadar next year!
