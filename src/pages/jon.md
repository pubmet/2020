# Jonathan P. Tennant (Jon)

It was a sunny September day when Jon arrived with a smile on his face at Zadar
airport, returning right from Bali to take part as invited speaker at our
[PUBMET2018](http://pubmet.unizd.hr/pubmet2018/) conference about open science.
Good-hearted and straightforward as he was, he helped me navigate a borrowed car
from the airport to the centre of Zadar, talking about weeks spent in Bali. This
is how our too brief but deep friendship began. Jon stayed in Zadar for four
days during which we spent a lot of time together discussing different topics
both related and unrelated to work. Uncompromising and passionate about his
work, Jon was absolutely one of the best advocates of open science. His
interests were many, and he lived them all to the fullest.

I first met Jon in September 2017 in Athens, when we both participated in a
session about peer review as part of [Open Science Fair
(OSF)](https://www.opensciencefair.eu/) conference organised by
[OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/). After that we met at many meetings and
conferences. The open science community is large, dynamic and full of
interesting and acomplished groups and individuals, but few of them have lived
open science in the way Jon did. Personally, I have participated in the
initiatives for openness in science for decades, and although some steps forward
are visible, they are often riddled with compromise, sometimes even misdirected,
obscured or not decisive enough. Considering the effects of all efforts that
have been invested, it seems to me sometimes that we are getting nowhere and
that vital changes in scholarly communication are not happening at all or are
happening extremely slowly. Decisive and resolute as he was, Jon articulated
best the challenges we were facing and their solutions, followed me in his own
introspection, shared his doubts with me, always finding optimistic solutions.
During our long conversations we were trying to predict possible outcomes of
different initiatives, but at the same time predict possible hurdles and their
repercussions.

Jon obtained his PhD in palaeontology from [Imperial College
London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), Department of Earth Science and
Engineering, and he studied the evolution of dinosaurs, crocodiles and other
animals, methodically encouraging changes in scholarly communication. That is
why he started an open publisher platform [paleorXiv](https://paleorxiv.org/).
For two years he was communications director of
[ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/). Jon took active part in editing
some of the most prestigious journals like PLOS Paleo Community, Geoscience
Communication, Journal of Evidence-Based Healthcare, etc. Among his many
activities are also leading a campaign against science privatisation at
[Education International](https://www.ei-ie.org/), he was a head of making the
[Strategy for open science](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/b4v8p/),
ambassador for ASAPbio and [Centre for open science](https://cos.io/), adviser
in [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), [Guaana](https://blog.guaana.com/) and
[ScienceMatters](https://www.sciencematters.io/), mentor within [Mozilla Open
Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/mozilla-open-leaders/)
and co-leader of Berlin’s [Open Science
meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Open-Science-Meetup/). He was a member of
[Global Young Academy](https://globalyoungacademy.net/) and independent
researcher at [IGDORE](https://igdore.org/). An author of a dozen of works
(https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7794-0218), he also published a children’s book
about dinosaurs (Excavate! Dinosaurs: Paper Toy Paleontology)! His numerous
interesting writings are also available in social media (Facebook and Twitter)
as @protohedgehog and blogger (http://fossilsandshit.com).

Jon often exposed as the root of the problem large publishers and the inability
of major changes in the environment in which 'growth' is dictated by the profit.
Although he chose his words carefully, he always clearly and without a shadow of
doubt stated his attitude that many shared but did not have courage to speak
out. With great enthusiasm he founded and built OpenScience MOOC (Massive Online
Open Community), promoting the values of open science, and gathering the
community of open practice and teaching new generations of young researcher
about it.

I will always remember Jon as a warm-hearted and cheerful person, always ready
to have fun, even when dealing with serious topics. What made him stand out most
among his peers was a complete lack of ego, unselfishness and willingness to
share all his contributions with the community, and his courage to be himself.
Of late, his life was marked by a mistreatment by the media, so he basically
withdrew, working on himself and his personal growth. My last cooperation with
Jon was a coauthorship with other colleagues on the paper [A tale of two opens:
Intersections between Free and Open Source Software and Open
Scholarship](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2kxq8/) which questions
differences and similarities between the communities of open code and open
science, and suggests steps that would bring to significant advancement within
both communities.

With Jon’s departing, the community of open science has lost its most arduous,
most selfless and bravest advocate. I have lost a dear friend, I will always
keep his memory deep down inside.
